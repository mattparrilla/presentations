## Standard Disclaimer

## What is Functional Programming?

> * A paradigm
> * Seeks to eliminate *side-effects* when possible
> * Declarative as opposed to imperative in style
> * Rooted in mathematics (Lambda Calculus)
> * Favors composability
> * Write pure functions

>> it's a WAY to write code, you're likely already doing some of the things Ben & I will be talking about, even if you don't know it
>> In declarative programming you describe WHAT you want to do, rather than how you want to do it. You tend to use more abstract tools, rather than bothering with the control flow.
>> This contrasts with imperative programming, which is probably the kind of programming that you started out doing, where you describe HOW to do the thing you're trying to describe. Think for loops and lots of conditionals.
>> there's a formal system, called Lambda Calculus, that provides the foundation that functional languages are built upon; but you don't need to know any kind of Calculus to write more functional code

# What is a pure function?

>> Pure functions are one of the central concepts of funcitonal programming.
>> Pure functions have no side effects, no side causes, and result in referential transparency. We'll unpack each of those
>> simply put, a pure function always returns the same result given the same arguments. It turns out, that's a very useful feature for some code!
>> declared inputs and outputs are the tip of the iceberg, but lurking beneath, out of view is a hulking behemoth of unknown danger, ready to sink your ship

## pure funcÂ·tion

* No *side-effects*
* No *side-causes*
* *Referential transparency*
* Saves us from the complexity iceberg

## Side-Effect

> * Hidden output
> * An observable interaction with the outside world
> * What does it do that isn't part of the return value?
> * Side effects are necessary to **do** things
> * ...but dangerous when unintentional
> * Obey SRP!

>> by "hidden output" we mean that a function does something besides provide a new return value. Maybe it changes some global state.
>> When to side effect: when you are doing it deliberately. If you are returning a value AND side effecting, you're not following SRP. If you're going to side effect, do it intentionally.
>> ASK: what are some examples of side effects that you might deliberately cause?
>> answers: print to a screen, write to file system, etc.

## Side-Cause

> * Hidden input
> * What does it need that isn't in the argument list?
> * "A function with side-causes has undocumented assumptions about what *external* factors it depends on."

## Referential Transparency

A pure function can be replaced by the value it returns.

>> referential transparency means that functional programs can be analyzed and evaluated as mathematics, and in true functional languages they can be optimized at compile time.

# Now, some examples!

## A Side Effect

    const myGlobalArray = [1, 1, 1];

    function someFunction(anArray) {
        const lastItem = anArray.pop();
        // do some stuff
        return resultOfStuff;
    };

    // elsewhere...
    const someValue = someFunction(myGlobalArray);
    const sum = myGlobalArray.reduce((a, b) => a + b); // 2!

## Another

    function doStuff(anObject) {
        var keys = Object.keys(anObject);
        cleanKeys(keys);

        return keys.filter(item => name !== 'Matt');
    }

---

Some array methods can cause unexpected side-effects if you don't know that they modify the array in place.

    const x = [1, 2, 3];
    const y = x.push(1);
    console.log(x); // [1, 2, 3, 1]

    const z = x.sort();
    console.log(x); // [1, 1, 2, 3]


>> It doesn't matter that we're creating a new reference, these array methods modify the original array in place.
>> The new reference just points to the reference, which has new values.
>> And it doesn't matter that we're using the `const` keyword. Const doesn't make the reference immutable, const will only throw if we try and reassign the reference.

## A Side-Cause

    import moment from 'moment';

    function getTodaysVisits(visits) {
        const today = moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD');

        return visits[today];
    }


## Is this pure?

    import moment from 'moment';
    const today = moment(), visits = {...};

    function getYearAgoVisits(visits, date) {
        const yearAgo = date.subtract(1, 'year');

        return visits[yearAgo];
    }

    getYearAgoVisits(visits, today);

# Why write pure functions?

## ![](http://orig10.deviantart.net/e188/f/2011/007/e/e/jack_and_rose_from_titanic_by_kaorixluvsxnachoes88-d36o22o.jpg)

> * Because we want to be happy!

## Pure functions are...

> * Easier to think about
> * Easier to test
> * Easier to debug
> * Easier to ...maintain!
> * More Reusable
> * Memoizable

>> it might take longer to write, but as developers we spend most of our time reading code. When the API of a function is all there is to it, it becomes a lot easier to think about.
>> my brain is single threaded. I want to think about this piece of code, right here in front of me, right now. I don't want to be avoiding icebergs all day.
>> when a function is allowed to depend on anything, and cause anything, the bugs could be anywhere!

## What do they cost?

> * More time up-front
> * Flexibility
> * Discipline
> * Missing anything?

>> am I missing anything?

## How can we write pure functions?

> * Declare all inputs as arguments
> * Write unit tests, they can help identify side causes
> * Write functions that return values, rather than "do stuff"
> * Don't mutate data

>> It's a lot easier to test functions that have all their inputs declared!
>> That last point is going to be the focus for the second part of my talk: immutability.

## One way to not mutate data: by convention

> * Use the array methods mentioned earlier
> * Make copies of things!
> * Discipline (again, and not just yours)

## Object.assign()

    const personalInfo = {
        name: 'Matt',
        town: 'Burlington',
        age: 29
    };

    const olderMatt = Object.assign(
        {},
        personalInfo,
        { age: 30 }
    );

## Spread Operator

A little syntactic sugar on top of Object.assign()

    const olderMatt = {
        ...personalInfo,
        age: 30
    };

    // where do people look up what stage features are in?

Part of ES2017

## But doing things by convention is hard...

# Immutability

## Benefits of immutability

> * "Like mutable data, but with one fewer feature: you can't edit it."
> * We often only need to read values
> * Protect your data from side effects
> * Cheap equality comparison

## Immutability 2 Ways

> * External Libraries
    * Immutable.js
    * seamless-immutable
> * Object.freeze

>> immutable data structures are one of our best defenses against side effects
>> it becomes a lot easier to avoid mutating global state when you can't

---

### Immutable.js

> * 12k stars
> * Persistence
> * Lazy Evaluation

### seamless-immutable

> * 1.6k stars
> * Backwards compatible with vanilla arrays and objects

## Object.freeze()

> * Out of the box only shallowly immutable
> * Updates fail silently or throw TypeError (in strict mode)
> * Object.isFrozen(*obj*)
> * Standard library

---

    const x = Object.freeze({ a: 1, b: 2 });
    x.a = 5;
    console.log(x); // { a: 1, b: 2}

    const y = Object.freeze({ a: 1, b: 2, c: [1, 2, 3]})
    y.c[0] = 5;
    console.log(y); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: [5, 2, 3]}

> * But you can deeply convert using both Object.freeze ([deepFreeze](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze#Examples)) and any of the immutable libraries.

# Why Immutability Is A Big Deal

## With a vanilla Javascript array

    const x = [1, 2, 3];

> * How to tell if x changed?
> * If I modify x[2], the reference to x doesn't change, but the value there has
> * In order to tell if x changed:
    * we can't just see if the reference has changed.
    * We need to check all of the values.

## With an immutable array

    const x = Immutable.List([1, 2, 3])

> * Because we can't mutate x, we know if that reference still exists, x hasn't changed
> * This costs the same regardless of size

## How it's used in the wild

    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {
        return this.props !== nextProps;
    }

> * If the reference is equal, no need to render.
> * You are guaranteed the data is the same.
> * Also big benefits for memoization

# So, how to write more functional code?

##

> * Declare all inputs
> * Be explicit about side-effects
> * Don't mutate your data
> * Better: use immutable data
> * Listen to Ben!
