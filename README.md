# Presentations

The format of these presentations may look a little strange, but that's because they're designed to be [turned directly into reveal.js slideshows](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html).

## For Example

If you run these commands in this project's directory:

    brew install pandoc
    npm install -g gulp
    npm install
    gulp

You turn [this markdown](https://github.dev.dealertrack.com/ddcmichaelhellein/presentations/blob/master/source/gulp.md) into [this presentation](https://github.dev.dealertrack.com/pages/ddcmichaelhellein/presentations/gulp.html#/).
