# Presentations

The format of these presentations may look a little strange, but that's because they're designed to be [turned directly into reveal.js slideshows](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html).

For example:

    brew install pandoc
    pandoc -t revealjs -s gulp.md -o gulp.html --slide-level 2

That also depends on the presence of reveal.js, but I'll add that to the repository at some future point.
